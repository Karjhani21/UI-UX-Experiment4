# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:
To design wireframe diagrams for a generic application or website using Balsamiq, incorporating at least five essential screens—Welcome/Splash, Login/Signup, Home/Dashboard, Content/Product Listing, and Checkout/Contact/Final Action—to demonstrate basic user flow and interface structure.

## Algorithm:
```
Step 1: Define the App/Website Purpose Choose a general-purpose application or website idea (e.g., e-commerce, food delivery, fitness app, blog). Briefly outline key user goals and basic functionalities.

Step 2: Plan the Screen Flow Identify and list the 5 essential screens: Welcome/Splash Screen Login/Signup Screen Home/Dashboard Screen Content/Product Listing Screen Checkout/Contact/Final Action Screen Sketch the basic flow of how users will navigate between these screens.

Step 3: Open Balsamiq and Create Wireframes Use Balsamiq or any wireframing tool with a low-fidelity approach. Screen 1: Welcome/Splas Add app name/logo Optional loading bar or “Get Started” button

Screen 2: Login/Signup Fields for email/username and password Buttons for login and sign-up Optional: social login options

Screen 3: Home/Dashboard Navigation bar (bottom or top) Summary of key features (e.g., categories, quick actions) User profile or menu access

Screen 4: Content/Product Listing Grid or list layout Filters/sorting options Item previews (image, name, short description)

Screen 5: Checkout/Contact/Final Action Final action options (e.g., buy, contact, submit form) Payment or confirmation section Navigation to return or exit

Step 4: Link Wireframes Add navigation arrows/buttons between screens to indicate flow. Ensure all screens are accessible and logical from a user journey perspective.

Step 5: Review and Refine Check for visual hierarchy, clarity, and completeness. Make sure wireframes follow basic UI/UX principles (simplicity, consistency, usability). Adjust alignment, spacing, and labeling for clarity.
